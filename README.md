# Is-it-a-Rumour
In this project I have created a model to classify the tweets as Rumour or Non Rumour. Further more the model was used to classify tweets based around Covid-19.The project has been done as a part of Natural Language Processing(NLP) Course at University of Melbourne.  

In this project I have explored the following techniques to generate a representation of tweets and their replies:  
1.GLoVe.  
2.Sentence Transformers.  
3.BERTweet. 

For details of the implementation details and the models please refer to the project report:Project_Report.pdf.
